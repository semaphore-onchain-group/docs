# Create group

Any NFT holder can create the corresponding NFT group, and the group is currently classified into 3 types: General, PoH and POAP (Other types can be added later).

- **General**: Basically, the group ID is the NFTâ€™s contract address. 

- **PoH**: In the case of PoH, the group ID is the contract address with '1' added to the front.

- **POAP**: In the case of POAP, since the contract address of all tokens is the same, the token name is used as the group ID.
