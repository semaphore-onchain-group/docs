# Create group

Any NFT holder can create the corresponding NFT group, and the group is currently classified into 3 types: General, PoH and POAP (Other types can be added later).

- **General**: Basically, the group ID is the NFTâ€™s contract address. 

- **PoH**: In the case of PoH, the group ID is the contract address with '1' added to the front.

- **POAP**: In the case of POAP, since the contract address of all tokens is the same, the token name is used as the group ID.


## Step 1 : Select NFT
Select the NFT you want to make the group.

## Step 2 : Select group type
Select the Type of the group (POAP tokens can only be selected as POAP types).
Select carefully when choosing a group type because joining group conditions vary depending on it.(you can see the conditions [here](join-leave-group.md))
You cannot create the group if the NFT group you selected already exists.

## Step 3 : Create group
Create the group and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.
