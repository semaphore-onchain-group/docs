# Join/Leave Group

Basically, if you own the NFT, you can join the corresponding group, but there are some conditions depending on the group type.
Also, you can leave the group whenever you want.

- **General**: n order to prevent a case of repeatedly using join/leave to a group while moving one NFT to multiple wallet addresses, it is necessary to hold the NFT for more than 24 hours to join a group.

- **PoH**: n the case of PoH, it is literally a token that proves that you are a human being, and since it can be used for anti-civil attack, it is blocked to join unless it is the first mint token.

- **POAP**: Same as PoH group.
