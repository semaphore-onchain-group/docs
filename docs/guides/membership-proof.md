# Membership Proof

You can create Semaphore proofs that can prove anonymously that you are a part of the group.
A developer guide to generating proof of membership will provided soon.

## Use cases

**KYC**

With PoH token, you can make the semaphore proof that prove you own the PoH token(so that you are a human being) without revealing your address, and furthermore, you can prove various characteristics and facts about you anonymously (for example, POAP token proves which event you've participated in).

**Voting**

By creating an NFT group membership proof, you can make the anti-sybil voting.
It can be used for anonymous voting within a specific group, such as quadratic funding where the proof of humanity is important, or anonymous DAO voting.
