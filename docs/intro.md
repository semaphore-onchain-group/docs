# Semaphore on-chain NFT group
This is a document for Semaphore on-chain NFT group open platform(** [Semaphore NFT group page](https://nft-group.vercel.app/) **).

Users can join the Semaphore NFT group  via holding NFT and can prove that they are the member of the group without revealing their identity.
You can create a group with any type of NFT in your wallet, and once a group is created, other users holding that NFT can join the group.

By generating a semaphore membership proof, members of the group can prove that they own the NFT without exposing their wallet address.
If the NFT is minted through Proof of Humanity certification, it can be used for apps that need to prevent sybil attacks like quadratic funding.
